Wow! I love Gatsby so much already.

## Question:
### “Why do I imagine myself to be a successful innovator of 2021?”
### Answer :

> As one of the great leader said, Innovation is the one factor that distinguishes between a leader and the followers.
> According to me every people has the right mind to be innovative and have chances to embrace the ideas and innovate
> something new. It all takes is a little bit risk and some courage to follow that direction.I
> imagine myself to be successful innovator this year because I will try
> to think and do things creatively.

> As summarized in a detailed review of over 100 scientific studies,
> creative people tend to be better at identifying (rather than solving)
> problems, they are passionate and sensitive, and, above all, they
> tend to have a hungry mind: they are open to new experiences,
> nonconformist, and curious. These personality characteristics are
> stronger determinants of creative potential than are IQ, school
> performance, or motivation.

> This year I’m planning to work with the team who is well creative and
> innovative as working in a team will create and multiply the factor of
> innovation in an idea.
> We know that the key diference between creativity and innovation is
> Execution and working with a team will make it feasilble.

> If we think and analyze we get 100s of ideas daily and
> entrepreneurship is the one thing which converts creative ideas into
> useful innovation. Opportunities are at the heart of entrepreneurship 
> and innovation, and some people are much more alert to them than
> others and in this 2021 year i will try to make and catch as much
> opportunity as possible.

> Contrary to popular belief, most successful innovators are not
> dropout geniuses, but well-trained experts in their field. So to identify
> the opportunities I need to know about them and education and
> training helps us in noticing new opportunities or interpreting events
> as promising opportunities.

> Serial innovators tend to use their connections and networks to
> mobilize resources and build strong alliances, both internally and
> externally. This means I will connect more and more people this year
> strong our alliances, help some individuals, contibute socially etc.

> Previous year has given us all setbacks but a leader is that who rise
> and make new opportunities from setbacks. There were many doors
> opened while some closed for eg. Technical advancement in online
> education, in online markets, medical fields, bussiness opportunities,
> and most importantly we learned to analyze ourself and it gave us
> time to think how to change your creative ideas in amazing
> innovation.

> I would only call myself a successful innovator if I have a long term
> vision, vision is where entrepreneurship meets leadership which will
> attract more effective and innovative team members and partners
> etc.

> In short, there is no point in just hoping for a breakthrough idea –
> what matters is my ability to generate more ideas, discover the right
> opportunities to develop them, and act with drive and dedication to
> achieve the final goal which we have decided.
> At last for being a successfull innovator I need to be optimistic,
> positive and motivated after having a clear vision and always move
> towards goal even after setbacks.
