# UX in Daily Life

So you may know UX but I'll tell you a little bit about it and then we will discuss various things.

I want to clear it first that UX not only refers to design but it helps us understand how a user interacts with a system and experiences a product, system or service. It involves a person's perceptions of utility, ease of use, and efficiency. UX plays a very important role in everyday's life. If we look close we can find UX in everything we use.

User Experience is like the emotional experience that customers have while engaging with a company website, products, services, apps, or any other form of a thing. We could find successful or failed user experiences in almost anything we experience daily. Just take a look around you. From your seat to the device you’re using. From the door in your room to the lights. From your furniture to each and every product you use every single day. From desktops to laptops, your phones, books etc all are made keeping UX in mind.

Many people think UX is only restricted to websites but I really have a much broader scope. I strongly believe that in every and everything we use in our daily life UX design needs to be corporated. It will minimize the pain points of the user which includes irritation, frustration while using the product.

We don't know yet but many times in many unknown ways UX affects our life without being noticed because they are part of our life. We take them as natural. We as users normally don't focus on design as it feels naturals until it's flawed. For example, everyone has mobile phones so we'll take an example of that. We can access and do almost anything using our mobile phones. But earlier they have big screen computers. So whoever noticed and thought we can decrease the size of the screen and fit contents on a small screen because they were not having a good experience with the big screen. Ofc it's right we cannot take computers everywhere but again we can take laptops to almost anywhere which is also a very good example of the use of user experience. More products become successful when they try to improve the user experience of using that product.

We heard the word successful and failed UX. So what are they? 

I'll tell you. Just look around you closely at the products you're using if you're comfortable in using them that means they are successful. For eg. the jeans you are wearing if you feel good you feel comfortable wearing them, it's made up of good material, you can run, walk, jump etc wearing it that means they are successful in making your experience better. In our childhood, many of us were fond of pens, pencil boxes, we had our favourite pens because someone must have thought that let's make this pen long-lasting, with good design so that children get attracted, people use it more etc.

Now talking about failed UX, there were many projects whenever we use we find it difficult, irritating, like when we use websites which has lots of ads popping we have to cut the ads, again and again, it may be frustrating which is not good for user experience so they came up with adblockers to improve our experience. Let's take an example you went inside a lift and it started going up, now it has very different buttons made using different designs but there was no clear information what to press to stop or open the lift. Now in confusion, you pressed another button and it makes the lift faster now if nothing working out you press all the buttons thinking that something will work.  So these are failed or bad UX which confuses people, make it hard for them to make decisions etc.

So UX of any product is made keeping in mind every group of people using whether they have a disability or they can't read etc everyone.  For eg in Android if you haven't noticed there is a talkback feature for blind people.  You can check it someday. go to settings then additional settings and then accessibility or search accessibility in settings that there is this talkback feature where it takes the phone in audio mode. Whenever you touch anything it will speak that you touched this icon etc. This feature was made keeping in mind the experience of blind people. So the industry tries to improve the experience of users as it is a proven fact that people like those products in which they don't have to work hard to understand.

## What is UX Design ?

The process by which design teams create products that give users with meaningful and relevant experiences is known as user experience design. This includes features of branding, design, usability, and function, as well as the full process of obtaining and integrating the product.

    ##As Steve  Krug said:

    A person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it’s worth

Now as we discussed few things earlier we will try to classify them. We will discuss now 7 key elements of UX design in any criteria.

### Useful

Although it may seem self-evident, the product, website, or app must provide a purpose for your intended audience. Why would the customer acquire it if it does not provide benefits to them?
It should do what the user or customer needs to be done.

### Learnable

In the show Friends, when Joey, Ross and Chandler play the game "Bamboozled", people laughed because their acting was awesome and the game was weird no one understood how it works.  If the user doesn’t understand the rules, it won’t work.
People should be able to complete basic tasks with ease the first time they encounter the design.

### Memorable

Is the product is memorable? People should not have to learn the rules, again and again, to know how the product works.
Users should be able to quickly re-establish expertise when they return to the design after a period of inactivity.

### Effective

The main role is that it gets the job done or not.
We set a number of objectives at the start of the project. To ensure that the product is effective to use, it should be tested against these goals on a regular basis.

### Efficient

So getting the job done is finished, now we should focus on how fast and effortlessly it gets the job done.
Are your products better than others? Do your products provide better results? If not then we need to refine the user's experience. This could be done by using A/B testing to compare products.

### Desirable

Do people prefer your product? We can see that the same type of products is sold in both supermarkets or streets. People find it more acceptable in Supermarkets as they believe that those products are safer.
The desirability thing is most of the time linked to a company's image, brand, and reputation, as well as the emotional response the product eflicts in the user.

### Delightful

Is your product delightful to look at? fun and easy to use? 
Successful things usually have a glow of excitement and fun that stimulates the consumer and makes them want to tell their friends and other people about it.
How smooth and easy it is to use the product and how effectively it fulfils the promises and how it brings a smile to the face of the user.

A smart place to start is to make sure the product is helpful, learnable, remembered, effective, efficient, desirable, pleasurable, and accessible too. Sometimes a distinguishing feature that separates our product from the competitors.

### Thankyou
